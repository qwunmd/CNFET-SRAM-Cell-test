  This repository is is used to archive the tested CNFET based SRAM cell .
  The tests is mainly about read and write delay.
  The sram schematics are built by candence. To use the Stanford CNFET Model, you can create symbols with veriloga file like this:
  
  PCNFET_L1 : include files left as-is - so the entire content was as it was in the download from Stanford
  PCNFET_L2 : remove the `include "PCNFET_L1.va" but add `include "parameters.vams" instead.
  PCNFET : use the code from the file PCNFET_L3.va, but remove the `include "PCNFET_L2.va" and add `include "parameters.vams" instead
  
  while building schematic, only use PCNFET.
  And also, you can use the HSPICE model.
